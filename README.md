# Random Classroom (CS50 Final Project)

## Description
Random Classroom is a web application that allows teachers to store class rosters and group students based on a number of criteria (gender, score, or random). 

You can watch a live demo of the project [here](https://youtu.be/wTq7EBhY_U4).

Once logged in, teachers can create and save class rosters. Classes can be archived for year-over-year functionality.

Teachers can group the students in each class in several ways, including Kagan-style groups (one student from each quartile, based on score). This is the feature I most wanted when I was teaching in a classroom.
